Transaction History: Users can view past transactions for each account.
Transactions:
Fund Transfer: Users can transfer money between accounts or to other users.
Deposit and Withdrawal: Users can deposit money into their accounts and withdraw funds.
Transaction Limits: Implement daily limits for transactions.
2. Additional Features:
Admin Panel:
User Management: Admins can manage user accounts (activate, deactivate, or delete).
Transaction Management: Admins can view and manage all transactions.
Account Management: Admins can create, modify, or close user accounts.
Notifications:
Email/SMS Notifications: Notify users of significant transactions, balance changes, or account activity.
Reports:
Account Statements: Users can generate and download account statements (PDF/CSV).
Transaction Reports: Admins can generate reports on transactions.
3. Technical Requirements:
Technology Stack:
Backend: Django, Django Rest Framework (for APIs)
Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL (for production), SQLite for development
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (possibly using frameworks like Bootstrap or React)
Hosting: AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean
Security:
Data Encryption: Use SSL/TLS for secure data transmission.
Password Hashing: Use Django's built-in password hashing.
CSRF Protection: Implement Cross-Site Request Forgery protection.
XSS Protection: Sanitize user inputs to prevent Cross-Site Scripting attacks.
4. Development Process:
Phase 1: Planning
Gather detailed requirements.
Design wireframes and database schema.
Define user stories and create a roadmap.
Phase 2: Setup
Set up Django project and applications.
Configure the database and models.
Phase 3: Development
Implement authentication and user profile features.
Develop bank account management and transaction functionalities.
Build the admin panel and notification system.
Phase 4: Testing
Conduct unit testing and user acceptance testing.
Fix bugs and ensure all features work as expected.
Phase 5: Deployment
Deploy the application to a hosting provider.
Set up monitoring and logging.
5. Additional Considerations:
Compliance: Ensure the application complies with relevant banking regulations (like GDPR, PCI DSS).
Performance: Optimize for speed, especially in transaction processing.
Scalability: Design the application architecture to handle growth in users and transactions.
This outline should give you a solid starting point for your banking web application. You can adjust the requirements and features based on your target audience and specific goals.
